# Other useful libraries

In this section we review some additional libraries that are very useful for scientific computing.

## `scipy` 

This module contains a collection of numerical algorithms such as integration,
optimization, interpolation, linear algebra, statistics, and much more.
It is built on top of `numpy`, i.e., it mainly uses numpy arrays as the main
data structure.

`scipy` is organized in submodules, each one with a specific purpose, which are imported separately as,

```python
import scipy.submodulename
#or
from scipy import submodulename
```

The submodules that normally fulfill the needs of a computatonal chemist are:

- `integrate`: Integration and ordinary differential equation solvers
- `interpolate`: Interpolation and smoothing splines
- `linalg`: Linear algebra, which actually provides an interface to BLAS and LAPACK libraries.
Note that it generally supports all `numpy.linalg` functions, and `scipy.linalg` versions are preferred.
- `optimize`: Optimization and root-finding routines

The list of submodules is completed with:

- `cluster`: Clustering algorithms
- `fft`: Fast Fourier Transform routines (this should replace the still existing `fftpack` module)
- `ndimage`: N-dimensional image processing
- `odr`: Orthogonal distance regression
- `signal`: Signal processing
- `sparse`: Sparse matrices and associated routines
- `spatial`: Spatial data structures and algorithms
- `special`: Special functions
- `stats`: Statistical distributions and functions
- `constants`: Physical and mathematical constants
- `io`: Input and Output
- `misc`: Miscellaneous utilities that donâ€™t have another home.

Let's see some examples of the most useful submodules in `scipy`.

### `scipy.integrate`

This submodule provides several integration routines, including an ordinary differential equation integrator.

**Integration** of a 1D function, can be done with the `quad` method, which uses the
[QUADPACK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUADPACK) Fortran library. For instance
    
```{code-cell} python
from scipy.integrate import quad
import numpy as np

def gaussian(x, mu, sigma):
    return 1/np.sqrt(2*np.pi*sigma**2)*np.exp(-(x-mu)**2/(2*sigma**2))

mu = 0
sigma = 1
norm, err = quad(gaussian, -np.inf, np.inf, args=(mu, sigma))
print(norm)
```

Other methods to integrated 1D functions are `fixed_quad`, `quadrature` or `romberg`.

Instead, integration of a discrete function (1D), i.e., a set of points,
can be done with the `trapz`, `romb` and `simps` functions.
For instance,

```{code-cell} python
from scipy.integrate import simps
import numpy as np

def gaussian(x, mu, sigma):
    return 1/np.sqrt(2*np.pi*sigma**2)*np.exp(-(x-mu)**2/(2*sigma**2))

x = np.linspace(-100, 100, 5000)
mu = 0
sigma = 1
y = gaussian(x, mu, sigma)
print(simps(y, x=x))
```

Integration of a multidimensional function can be done with the following methods:

- `dblquad`: General purpose double integration.
- `tplquad`: General purpose triple integration.
- `nquad`: General purpose n-integration.

This module also provides methods to integrate **ordinary differential equations**. 
The recommended method is `solve_ivp` (solve initial value problem), 
which is a modern integrator for ordinary differential equations.

For instance, in order to integrate the following system of differential equations,

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{dx}{dt} &= -y \\
\frac{dy}{dt} &= x
\end{align}
$$

we can use the following code,

```python
from scipy.integrate import solve_ivp
import numpy as np

def f(t, y):
    return [-y[1], y[0]]
    
t0 = 0
tf = 10
y0 = [1, 0]
t_eval = np.linspace(t0, tf, 100)
sol = solve_ivp(f, [t0, tf], y0, t_eval=t_eval)
```
The integration algorithm is set with the `method` attribute. Available methods are
summarized in the following table.

| Method | Description                                                                                                                      |
| --- |----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `RK45` | Explicit Runge-Kutta method of order 5(4). This is the default method.                                                           |
| `RK23` | Explicit Runge-Kutta method of order 3(2).                                                                                       |
| `DOP853` | Explicit Runge-Kutta method of order 8.                                                                                          |
| `Radau` | Implicit Runge-Kutta method of the Radau IIA family of order 5.                                                                  |
| `BDF` | Implicit multi-step variable-order (1 to 5) method based on a backward differentiation formula for the derivative approximation. |
| `LSODA` | Adams/BDF method with automatic stiffness detection and switching.                                                               |

The  older `odeint` function is also available, and provides a robust integrator
for ordinary differential equations based on the
using the FORTRAN library [odepack](https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/odepack).
It is still extensively used, mainly in legacy code.

### `scipy.interpolate`

This submodule provides several interpolation routines. In the case of 1D interpolation, i.e.
from a discrete set of $(x,y)$ points, the most common method is `interp1d`. This function takes
as arguments the `x` and `y` arrays, and returns a function that can be evaluated at any point,
within the range of `x` (values out of this range can be managed with the `fill_value` argument).
For instance,

```{code-cell} python
from scipy.interpolate import interp1d
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = np.linspace(0, 10, 10)
y = np.sin(x)
f = interp1d(x, y, kind='cubic')

xnew = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
ynew = f(xnew)

plt.plot(x, y, 'o', xnew, ynew, '-')
plt.show()
```

As shown in the above example, the `kind` argument specifies the type of interpolation. Possible
values are indicated in the following table.

| Kind | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `linear` | Linear interpolation (default). |
| `nearest` | Nearest-neighbor interpolation. |
| `zero` | Zero-order hold interpolation. |
| `slinear` | Piecewise linear interpolation. |
| `quadratic` | Piecewise quadratic interpolation. |
| `cubic` | Piecewise cubic interpolation. |
| `previous` | Use previous value. |
| `next` | Use next value. |

For 2D interpolation, the most general function is `interp2d`. This function takes as arguments
a 2D array of values, `Z`, and the two 1D arrays of coordinates, `x` and `y`. These arrays
do not have to be equally spaced. As in the 1D case, it returns a function that can be evaluated 
at any point.

```{code-cell} python
from scipy.interpolate import interp2d
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = np.linspace(0, 10, 10)
y = np.linspace(0, 10, 10)
X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)
Z = np.sin(X) + np.cos(Y)

f = interp2d(x, y, Z, kind='cubic')

xnew = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
ynew = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
znew = f(xnew, ynew)

plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
plt.pcolormesh(X, Y, Z)
plt.colorbar()
plt.title('Original')
plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
plt.pcolormesh(xnew, ynew, znew)
plt.colorbar()
plt.title('Interpolated')
plt.show()
```

As you can see, we use some kind of *advanced* `matplotlib` features in this example. 
You might be not familiar to them yet, but you will learn about them in the next chapter.
We also use the `np.meshgrid` function, which is very useful to generate 2D arrays with 
the grid points, (`x`,`y`), from the 1D arrays, `x` and `y`. The interpolation method is
specified with the `kind` argument, which can take the same values as in the 1D case.

The above example uses a regular grid, but this is not a requirement. Actually, in this case
we can use the function `RectBivariateSpline`, which is more efficient. This function takes
the same arguments as `interp2d`.

Finally, it is worth mentioning the function to interpolated unstructured data: `griddata`. 
This function takes as arguments the coordinates of the data points as a tuple of 1D arrays,
`(x,y)` and the values at these points, `z`, also a 1D array. 
It also takes the coordinates of the points where the interpolation is required, `(Xi,Yi)`. 
In this case, it returns the interpolated values at these points as a 2D array `Zi`.
The interpolation method is specified with the `method` argument. Possible values are `linear`,
`nearest` and `cubic`.

### `scipy.optimize`

This module provides several optimization algorithms. The most common one is `minimize`,

## `sympy`

This module is a computer algebra system (CAS), such as [Maxima](https://maxima.sourceforge.io) 
or Mathematica.

## `pandas`

This module provides high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools.

## `h5py`

This module provides support to manipulate [HDF5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDF5) files, 
a format specifically designed to store large amounts of numerical data. 
There are other formats that are also very useful for this purpose, such as
[netCDF](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/),
[JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) or
[XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML),
