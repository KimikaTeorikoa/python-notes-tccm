# Python Fundamentals
In this chapter, we will introduce you to the very basics
of computer programming with Python. We will first see
some basics that will make you understand how a Python 
program looks, and then we will go through how to 
write basic instructions for reading and writing
inside a computer program, the types of variables
we can use. We will finalize introducing functions.
