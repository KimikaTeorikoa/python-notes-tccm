# Setting yourself up
This course will be highly interactive, and students will be doing 
a lot of typing. For this, it will be very convenient to have a user
friendly environment ready to write programs and run Python code.
Of course, you are free to choose from other alternatives if you 
prefer, but here we present a minimal set of tools to work with.

## The terminal
In order to run Python code and receive its output, we will need 
to interact with a program called the command line or terminal. 
Depending of your operative system, access to the command line 
differs somewhat. Below, we offer different options depending on
the operative system that runs in the machine that you are using
for the course.

````{tab-set}
```{tab-item} Linux
Regardless of the distribution you are using, your OS will
have a native Unix Shell which is usually 
[Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/). Typically, it
will either be the Gnome Terminal, the KDE Konsole or xterm.
You can find them in the Applications menu.
```

```{tab-item} Mac OS X
The OS running in Apple computers comes with an application
called Terminal that you can find in the Utilities folder. 
You can open it by searching for Terminal in Spotlight. 
Alternatively, you can install a more customizable terminal
called iTerm. You may find that the terminal runs a different
Unix shell, [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/). You can change your
shell typing `chsh -s /bin/bash`.
```

```{tab-item} Windows
Windows does not come with a native Unix terminal, but there
are a number of alternatives like the bash terminal that
comes with [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/).
Alternatively, you can install the [Ubuntu terminal for
Windows](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-on-wsl2-on-windows-10).
```

## Text editor

## The Anaconda Python distribution 
Your computer may have a native Python installed with the operative
system. However, we strongly recommend that you install the 
[**Anaconda Python distribution**](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution), 
which comes with all you are likely to need
in your first encounter with Python. Also, make sure that you 
have **Python 3.x**. 

In parts of the course, we will run Python on a
web interface (e.g. using Jupyter notebooks). For this, you will need 
a browser like Chrome, Safari or Firefox.
