## A note on indentation
In Python, the way that a program looks is 
very much determined by indentation. This 
differs from what we will find in other languages
like Fortran or C, where formatting is not so
important. In this chapter we will use indentation
exhaustively, because as you will see it is essential
for flow control. 
When you write an `if` statement in
Python, you must respect the right indentation,
e.g.
```python
if x < 12:
    print (x)
```
And if not, the code will simply not run. 
Different levels of indentation start where 
we have colons (`:`), and these have to be 
indented with respect to the previous level
of indentation. Be 
careful not to add white spaces where they do not
belong and use consistently tabs or spaces
(4 spaces is the preferred option in 
[PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#indentation)). 
This may feel like a nuisance if you have
experience in some other programming language, but
will help orient yourself when reading code in the
long run.
