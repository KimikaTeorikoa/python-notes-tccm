# Welcome
In this course we aim to help you understand some 
fundamental principles of computer programming. 
In this case, we will be using 
[**Python**](https://www.python.org/) as our programming
language due to its widespread application in computational
chemistry. Python can be seen as a programming language 
but also as a scripting tool. It can be used to write 
software packages, but also for data analysis and 
visualization using a web browser as an interface. Python
can be run locally in your computer in a number of 
different ways, but also on collaborative notebooks online. 
We will try to introduce you to all of these possibilities, 
which have made Python be dubbed a "Swiss army knife" of coding.

Below, you can find the syllabus of the course, with the
topics that we will be covering, and also a list of
references that we recommend.
