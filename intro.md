# Welcome
In the next few weeks we will try to help you understand 
some fundamental principles of computer programming. 
In this case, we will be using [**Python**](https://www.python.org/) as our programming
language due to its widespread application in computational
chemistry. This is not an easy choice, as you will 
hopefully learn throughout the course. Python is peculiar 
in a number of ways. It be seen both a programming language 
as much as a scripting tool. It can be used to write 
software packages but also for data analysis and 
visualization using a web browser as an interface. Python
can be run locally in your computer in a number of 
different ways,
but also on collaborative notebooks online. We will try to 
introduce all of these possibilities, which have made 
Python be dubbed a "Swiss army knive" of coding.

Below, you can find the syllabus of the course, with the
topics that we will be covering, and also a list of
references that we recommend for the course.
