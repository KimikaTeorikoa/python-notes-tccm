# Setting yourself up for the Programming in Python Course

Welcome to the course. In the next few weeks we will try you with the
tools to understand software programming and, speciphically, programming
with Python. For this, it will be very convenient to have a user friendly
environment to do the programming. Of course, you are free to choose from
other alternatives that you prefer.

It does not go in-depth into any particular topic - check out [the Jupyter Book documentation](https://jupyterbook.org) for more information.

Check out the content pages bundled with this sample book to see more.
