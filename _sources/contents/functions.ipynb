    "# Functions\t\n",
    "We have already explored many things that can be done using Python, and\n",
    "specifically in the [previous chapter](flowcontrol.md), how to do\n",
    "them over and over again. Sometimes, as your code gets more complicated,\n",
    "it will make sense to **abstract** some of the computations that you are doing\n",
    "and isolate them into a separate piece of code. This set of actions \n",
    "will be performed by a **function**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are useful for a number of reasons:\n",
    "* They make your code more *readable*.\n",
    "* Using functions you may *shorten* your code, avoiding repetitive actions.\n",
    "* They make your code easier to *debug*.\n",

    "are the *set of variables we pass on to a function* for it to work with.\n",
    "When we call a function, we typically expect something back. \n",
    "In the case of the `print()` function we expect output in the `stdout`.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "y = my_function(x, a, b)\n",

    "    # A number of actions that take place inside the function\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    return value1, value2\n",
    "```\n",
    "As you see, to write a function we must first use the `def` *statement*,\n",
    "after which come the *name of your function*, with *parenthesis*, and \n",
    "its *function arguments*, `arg1` and `arg2`, will follow. \n",
    "Then starts an *indented block* that can be as long\n",
    "as required. The function usually will end with a `return` *statement*, \n",
    "which can return one or multiple values, or nothing at all. We call this type\n",
    "of function with no returns **void function**.  In a void function we can omit the `return` statement altogether.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions must be *defined before they are used*. This will normally mean\n",
    "that the function is written above the main code we are running.\n",
    "If one function calls another function, then it does not matter which\n",
    "order they appear as long as the code is not executed. \n",
    "For example, in this code,"
