    "# Python Fundamentals\n",
    "In this chapter, we will introduce you to the very basics\n",
    "of computer programming with Python. We will first see\n",
    "some general notions that will make you understand how a Python \n",
    "program looks. Then we will go through how to \n",
    "write basic instructions for reading and writing\n",
    "inside a computer program. We will also explain the types\n",
    "of variables we can use.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Python is a **high-level programming language**,\n",
    "like others you may have heard about, including\n",
    "Fortran, C or C++. High-level\n",
    "languages differ from low-level languages in that\n",
    "the former can be easily understood by people, while\n",
    "the latter are those that can be understood by machines. \n",
    "So when writing in a high-level language we normally\n",
    "need to translate the actions in our code to \n",
    "machine-readable format.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have ever done any programming before using \n",
    "languages like Fortran, C or C++, you surely adopted\n",
    "a workflow where you first wrote code and then \n",
    "compiled it using another program called **compiler**,\n",
    "wich generated a binary, machine-readable file. \n",
    "It would look something like this\n",
    "\n",
    "![compiling](https://hpc-wiki.info/mediawiki/hpc_images/8/8a/Compiler_Shematic.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "That will *not* be the case with Python. One of the\n",
    "key differences between Python and those other programming\n",
    "languages is that Python is an **interpretive** language.\n",
    "Hence you will not have to compile the code as you\n",
    "modify it. The **Python interpreter** performs those \n",
    "actions for you. \n",
    "\n",
    "All of these comes with a caveat. \n",
    "Because Python is not compiled, your\n",
    "programs written in Python will not be as fast as they \n",
    "could be when written in Fortran, C or C++.\n",
    "Below you can see a comparison between speeds of various\n",
    "programming languages \n",
    "\n",
    "![performance-speed](https://niklas-heer.github.io/speed-comparison/assets/latest/combined_results.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "```{hint}\n",
    "Clearly, Python is not the fastest language in town. There\n",
    "are workarounds for this, like linking Python and C or Fortran\n",
    "code, or using [Cython](https://cython.org/).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Writing your first Python program\n",
    "Let's see how running a simple Python program works in \n",
    "practice. Using your IDE or terminal, open a text editor\n",
    "and write the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "#!/usr/bin/env python\n",
    "# Our first Python program\n",
    "print (\"Hello World!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's examine what we have just written. \n",
    "You will notice that the first couple of lines \n",
    "that we have written start with a hash symbol (`#`). \n",
    "This means that whatever follows will not be read by the \n",
    "Python interpreter. This is what we usually regard as \n",
    "a **comment**. Then there is a `print` statement \n",
    "followed by a parentheses `()` with a piece of text\n",
    "inside. And that is all there is to our first Python\n",
    "program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now close the file, save it as `hello_world.py` and run \n",
    "the following command on your terminal\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "foo@bar:~$ python hello_world.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now check whether the program has done as you intended it to.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Names and cases\n",
    "In your programs you will usually be defining lots of different\n",
    "variables. *Variables are names for values* and the naming of \n",
    "variables follow some conventions. For example, they can \n",
    "be formed by letters, numbers and only one symbol, the \n",
    "underscore `_`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Something else you must remember is that Python\n",
    "is **case sensitive**, so when you try to use \n",
    "a variable without regard to the case you used to \n",
    "assign it a value, things will not go well."

    "highly informative and often direct you to the exact line\n",
    "where the problem is.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, in Python some possibilities are forbidden, like\n",
    "starting a variable with a number. If you write code including \n",
    "something like:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "77david = 'myname'\n",

    "an example of using meaningful variable names. Using cryptic \n",
    "variable names will make everyone miserable, so it is a good \n",
    "investment to use names that seem sensible choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, in Python there are naming conventions\n",
    "that you should follow. These are described in\n",
    "[PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#prescriptive-naming-conventions).\n",
    "For example, variables are typically written in lowercase, \n",
    "and so are functions. On the other hand, classes, which \n",
    "we will learn about in the future, use the so-called\n",
    "CapWords style.\n",

    "## Input / Output\t\n",
    "In our first program `hello_world.py` above, we have already \n",
    "written to something we call the \"standard output\", i.e. the \n",
    "display, using the `print` function. The `print` function\n",
    "displays values as text.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "In Python there are many other ways to write your output\n",
    "and also to read input into a program. You can, for example,\n",
    "make your program write the results of a calculation\n",
    "to a file instead of to your screen, or prompt the user to \n",
    "write a set of input variables using the keyword for the \n",
    "program to read (this would be the \"standard input\"). \n",
    "Here we explore the basics of Input / Output operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Opening and closing files\n",
    "Suppose that there is a file in your working directory\n",
    " called `myfile.txt` from which you want to read its contents. \n",
    "In order to do that, you will have to write \n",
    "```python\n",
    "f = open(\"myfile.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this statement, we are using a **built-in function** called `open`.\n",
    "The first argument of this function is the external filename (Python\n",
    "will assume that the file does exist). The second argument indicates \n",
    "the processing **mode**. There are different modes available:\n",
    "* `r`: read only mode\n",
    "* `w`: write only mode\n",
    "* `a`: append mode\n",
    "* `r+`: read and write mode\n",
    "*  `t`: text mode\n",
    "* `b`: binary mode\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the type of data in the file and what you intend to use \n",
    "the file for, you will choose one of these ways of opening the file. \n",
    "As a good programming habbit, remember to close files once you no \n",
    "longer need to access them:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "f.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "Another way of opening files in Python is using **file iterators**.\n",
    "You are using them when you open files using the \n",
    "`with` statement, which works as\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open(\"myfile.txt\", \"r\") as f:\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this case you do not need to close the file yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "### Reading and writing data into files \n",
    "Once you have opened a file, you will many times want to read its \n",
    "contents. You can do that *line by line* for the `myfile.txt` which \n",
    "you have opened and named as `f` in your program doing\n",
    "```python\n",
    "f.readline()\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can *bulk-read* all the file using `readlines()` instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, if you want to write into your file, you will\n",
    "first have to open it for writing. Then, you will be able to write\n",
    "into the file using the following statement\n",
    "```python\n",
    "f = open(\"test.txt\", \"w\")\n",
    "f.write(\"hello world!\\n\")\n",
    "f.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "where we are simply writing a text string. As we go along, we\n",
    "will greatly expand our understanding of Input/Output operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{exercise}\n",
    ":nonumber:\n",
    ":class: dropdown\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you remember our first Python program called `hello_world.py`?\n",
    "In a IPython session or using a Jupyter-notebook, open that\n",
    "file using both `open` and an iterator and write its contents\n",
    "as text. Pay attention to how these are written.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Types\n",
    "Variables in Python can be of many different types,\n",
    "including **text strings**, **lists**, **integers**, **floats**\n",
    " and **Boolean**. In Python variables take the form of **objects**, \n",
    "although we will not explain what this highly consequential fact\n",
    " entails just yet. \n",
    "For now, we will just say that objects are *pieces of memory, \n",
    "with values and sets of associated operations*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, *a variable is created when you assign a value to it*.\n",
    "Assignment of a value to a variable is simply made using the equal\n",
    " operator (`=`) in statements like\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "Because Python has **dynamic typing**, you do not have to declare \n",
    "variables. Python will assign a type to each variable in your code. \n",
    "In order to know the type of a given variable, you can use\n",
    "the intrinsic function `type`. For the variable you just created\n",
    "you can find the type using"

    "### F-Strings: Formatted String Literals\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to basic string operations, Python offers a powerful feature called **f-strings** (formatted string literals) that allows for more dynamic and readable string formatting. F-strings were introduced in Python 3.6 and provide an intuitive way to embed expressions directly within string literals.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create an f-string, simply prefix your string with the letter `f` or `F`. You can include variables or expressions inside curly braces `{}` within the string, which will be evaluated at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, consider the following code:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "event_name = \"Python Workshop\"\n",
    "date = \"October 15, 2024\"\n",
    "location = \"Community Center\"\n",
    "event_details = f\"The {event_name} will be held on {date} at the {location}.\"\n",
    "print(event_details)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "the output is\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "The Python Workshop will be held on October 15, 2024 at the Community Center.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the variables `event_name`, `date`, and `location` are directly embedded in the string, providing clear \n",
    "information about the event.\n",
    "\n",
    "F-strings also allow you to include expressions. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "width = 10\n",
    "height = 5\n",
    "area = f\"The area of the rectangle is {width * height} square units.\"\n",
    "print(area)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "gives the output\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "The area of the rectangle is 50 square units.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the expression `width * height` is evaluated, and its result is included in the f-string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, f-strings support formatting options, making it easy to control how numbers are displayed:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pi = 3.14159\n",
    "formatted_pi = f\"Pi rounded to two decimal places is {pi:.2f}.\"\n",
    "print(formatted_pi)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and the output is\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Pi rounded to two decimal places is 3.14.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `.2f` format specifier rounds pi to two decimal places.\n",
    "We will see more on F-strings in when reviewing [printing](printing) methods more in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lists, tuples and dictionaries\n",
    "**Lists** are a very important type of **sequence**, which\n",
    "in Python is a type of data structures that contain a \n",
    "collection of elements. In the last section, we have generated \n",
    "one such object\n",
    "```python\n",
    "['bread', ' butter', ' flour', ' milk']\n",
    "```\n",
    "which is of course a list of strings. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lists are defined when the list of elements is written inside square\n",
    "brackets (`[ ]`). If you were using parenthesis instead,\n",
    "(`( )`) then you would be defining what we call a **tuple**.\n",
    "Finally, there are **dictionaries**, which are defined\n",
    "using curly brackets (`{ }`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists and tuples can contain all sorts of data types. You\n",
    "can for example combine numerics and strings.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "mylist = [\"I\", \"am\", 30, \"years\", \"old\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Also, you can easily convert between lists and tuples\n",
    "```python\n",
    "mytuple = tuple(mylist)\n",
    "```\n",
    "The main difference between lists and tuples is that the\n",
    "latter are immutable, while you are allowed to change\n",
    "lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operators work with lists and tuples like they did with\n",
    "strings. Addition is concatenation and multiplication is\n",
    "repetition. For example,"
