    "## A note on indentation\n",
    "In Python, the way that a program looks is \n",
    "very much determined by **indentation**. This \n",
    "differs from what we will find in other languages\n",
    "like Fortran or C, where formatting is not so\n",
    "important. In this chapter we will use indentation\n",
    "exhaustively, because as you will see it is essential\n",
    "for flow control.\n",

    "### Logical tests and conditional operators\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, some words on logical tests and conditional operators are in order.\n",
    "Logical tests are expressions that evaluate to `True` or `False` \n",
    "and correspond to variables of type `bool` (Booleans, as seen in the \n",
    "[previous chapter](fundamentals.md)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Logical tests are built using conditional operators. \n",
    "The most common ones are `==` (equal), `!=` (not equal), `>` (greater than), \n",
    "`<` (less than), `>=` (greater than or equal to), `<=` (less than or equal to).\n",
    "As you would expect, these comparison operators give the following results:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "1 == 2 # False\n",
    "1 != 2 # True\n",
    "1 < 2 # True\n",
    "1 > 2 # False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "There is another operator, `is`, that is similar to `==` but checks if two variables\n",
    "are the same **object** (point to the same address in memory). \n",
    "In general, for two different variables with the same value, this operator evaluates to `False`.\n",
    "For instance, if we compare two different float variables with the same value.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 1.0\n",
    "y = 1.0\n",
    "x == y # True\n",
    "x is y # False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But this is not always the case for integers, because Python caches the most commonly used\n",
    "integers, so that they are the same object in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 1\n",
    "y = 1\n",
    "x == y # True\n",
    "x is y # True\n",
    "\n",
    "# But with larger integers this is not the case:\n",
    "x = 1554223641\n",
    "y = 1554223641\n",
    "x == y # True\n",
    "x is y # False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in general, we use `==` to compare values (i.e., what we normally intend to do) and `is` to compare objects.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "Another useful operator we have already seen is `in` (a *membership* operator), which checks if a value is \n",
    "contained in a list, tuple or dictionary (or a string).\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "1 in [1, 2, 3] # True\n",
    "1 in [2, 3, 4] # False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Logical tests can be combined using the logical operators `and`, `or` and `not`. \n",
    "They work as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "True and False # False\n",
    "True or False # True\n",
    "not True # False\n",
    "not False # True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it is also worth mentioning that some non-boolean values can be evaluated\n",
    "as `True` or `False`. For instance, the number `0` is evaluated as `False`, while\n",
    "any other number is evaluated as `True`. Similarly, the empty string `\"\"` is evaluated\n",
    "as `False`, while any other string is evaluated as `True`. An empty list also evaluates\n",
    "as `False`, while any other list evaluates as `True`.\n",
    "We can directly use such non-booleans as logical tests within `if` statements, which are \n",
    "first converted to booleans. The resulting boolean can be made explicit using the \n",
    "`bool` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "bool(0) # False\n",
    "bool(1) # True\n",
    "bool(\"\") # False\n",
    "bool(\"Hello\") # True\n",
    "bool([]) # False\n",
    "bool([1, 2, 3]) # True\n",
    "```\n",

    ":nonumber:\n",
    ":class: dropdown\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a code that uses non-booleans in logical tests, and check\n",
    "how are they evaluated. You can follow the scheme below:\n",

    "## Loops (for / while)\n",
    "\n",
    "Loops play a crucial role in automating repetitive tasks. Many times, we\n",
    "will want to do the same thing over and over. Occasionally, we may want to \n",
    "stop when a condition is or is not fulfilled. In these situations, loops become\n",
    " essential tools for processing data and performing calculations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have a list of numbers, and you want to calculate their sum. \n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "```\n",
    "To find the sum of these numbers, you could manually add them up:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "Sum = numbers[0] + numbers[1] + numbers[2] + numbers[3] + numbers[4]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, what if you had a list with hundreds or thousands of numbers? \n",
    "Performing this calculation manually would be \n",
    "impractical. This is precisely where loops come into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "### For loops\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore a `for` loop in Python to calculate the sum of numbers in a list.\n",
    " The for loop iterates over each element\n",
    "in the list and accumulates the sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "total_sum = 0  # Initialize the sum\n",
    "\n",
    "for num in numbers:\n",
    "    total_sum = total_sum + num  # Add each number to the sum\n",
    "    \n",
    "print(\"The sum of numbers is:\", total_sum)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the `for` loop allows us to automate the process of summing the elements in the list, \n",
    "making it efficient and scalable. Note that the indentation is required and the colon at the end of the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `range()` function is often used in conjunction \n",
    "with `for` loops to create a sequence of numbers that you can iterate through. The `range()` function generates a sequence\n",
    "of numbers based on the parameters you provide. It has three possible forms:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `range(stop)`: Creates a sequence from 0 up to (but not including) the `stop` value\n",
    "- `range(start, stop)`: Creates a sequence from start up to (but not including) the stop value.\n",
    "- `range(start, stop, step)`: Creates a sequence from start up to (but not including) the stop value, \n",
    "with a specified step size.\n",
    "\n",
    "You then use a `for` loop to iterate over the elements in the generated sequence. In each iteration of the loop, \n",
    "a variable takes on the value of the current element in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a basic example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(5):\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `range(5)` generates a sequence from 0 to 4, and the for loop iterates through these values.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "0\n",
    "1\n",
    "2\n",
    "3\n",
    "4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `for` loops can also be used with any kind of variables\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fruits=['apple', 'lemon','watermelon']\n",
    "\n",
    "for fruit in fruits:\n",
    "    print(fruit)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**While loops**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we consider a scenario where you want to find the sum of numbers until a certain condition is met. \n",
    "For instance, you want to find the sum of numbers until the cumulative sum exceeds 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "total_sum = 0\n",
    "index = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "while total_sum <= 10:\n",
    "    total_sum = total_sum + numbers[index]\n",
    "    index = index + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"The sum of numbers until the cumulative sum exceeds 10 is:\", total_sum)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{hint}\n",
    "Take care when using `while` loops, as they can easily lead to infinite loops.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{exercise}\n",
    ":nonumber:\n",
    ":class: dropdown\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a code snippet that calculates and prints the sum of all even numbers from 1 to\n",
    " a given positive integer using both a for loop and a while loop. \n",
    "Compare the results obtained from both loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pattern Matching (`match` statement)\n",
    "Starting from **Python 3.10**, Python introduced the **`match`** statement, \n",
    "which allows for **pattern matching**. This is similar to the `switch` or `select case` statements in other programming \n",
    "languages. It provides an elegant way to match values against a series of patterns and execute code based on which pattern is matched.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic syntax in Python is as follows:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "match variable:\n",
    "    case pattern1:\n",
    "        # Actions if variable matches pattern1\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "    case pattern2:\n",
    "        # Actions if variable matches pattern2\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "    case _:\n",
    "        # Actions if none of the above patterns match\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this structure, Python tries to match the value of variable with the specified patterns. The underscore **`(_)`** \n",
    "serves as a wildcard pattern, which catches any value that doesn’t match the previous cases. This acts similarly to an \n",
    "`else` statement in conditionals.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def check_number(n):\n",
    "    match n:\n",
    "        case 1:\n",
    "            print(\"n is 1\")\n",
    "        case 2:\n",
    "            print(\"n is 2\")\n",
    "        case _:\n",
    "            print(\"n is something else\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, the function `check_number` uses match to determine the value of n and execute the corresponding \n",
    "block of code. The `match` statement enhances code clarity and reduces the need `for` long chains of \n",
    "`if-elif-else` statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "## \tIterators and generators\n",
    "\n",
    "**Iterators** and **generators** are both mechanisms in Python for working with sequences of data. They allow you to iterate through a collection of items one at a time. \n",
    "They both allow you to loop through a sequence of values, but they differ in how they are implemented and when they generate values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Iterators\n",
    "\n",
    "An iterator is an object that represents a *stream of data*. \n",
    "It allows you to traverse a sequence of elements one at a time without loading the entire sequence into memory. \n",
    "In Python, an iterator is implemented using two methods: `__iter__()` and `__next__()`\n",
    ".\n",
    "   - `__iter__()`: Returns the iterator object itself and is called when you create an iterator from an iterable object (e.g., a list or a custom class).\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - `__next__()`: Retrieves the next element from the iterator and raises the `StopIteration` exception when there are no more elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an example of a simple iterator:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "lista = ['Charles', 'John', 'Python', 'pato', 3]\n",
    "a = iter(lista)\n",
    "print(a)\n",
    "print(next(a))\n",
    "\n",
    "while True:\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        print(next(a)) # fetch the position in the array\n",
    "    except: \n",
    "        break # exit the loop on error\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also create your own custom iterators by defining **classes**\n",
    " with `__iter__()` and `__next__()` methods, or you can use built-in Python functions like `iter()` and `next()` with iterable objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Doublen:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, start, end):\n",
    "        self.current = start\n",
    "        self.end = end\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __iter__(self):\n",
    "        return self\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __next__(self):\n",
    "        if self.current > self.end:\n",
    "            raise StopIteration\n",
    "        x=2*self.current\n",
    "        self.current += 1\n",
    "        return x\n",
    "\n",
    "my_iterator = Doublen(1, 8)\n",
    "print(my_iterator)\n",
    "\n",
    "for ii in my_iterator:\n",
    "    print(ii)\n",
    "```\n",
    "The output will be\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "<__main__.Doublen object at 0x106b4de10>\n",
    "2\n",
    "4\n",
    "6\n",
    "8\n",
    "10\n",
    "12\n",
    "14\n",
    "16\n",
    "```\n",
    "We will look in greater detail into how to write your own classes in the\n",
    "[Object Oriented Programming](ooprogramming.md) chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generators\n",
    "A generator is a concise way to create iterators. \n",
    "The main difference is that a generator is a function that contains one or more `yield` statements. \n",
    "When you call a generator function, it returns a generator object, which you can use to iterate through the values produced by the `yield` statements.\n",
    "Generator functions use the `yield` keyword to yield values one at a time, and they automatically retain their execution state between calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may create a generator function by defining a function with one or more `yield` statements. \n",
    "When you call this function, it doesn't execute immediately but returns a generator object. \n",
    "You can then iterate through the values by\n",
    "calling the generator's `__next__()` method or using a `for` loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def number_generator(start, end):\n",
    "    current = start\n",
    "    while current < end:\n",
    "        yield current\n",
    "        current = current + 1\n",
    "        \n",
    "my_generator = number_generator(1, 5)\n",
    "print(my_generator)\n",
    "for num in my_generator:\n",
    "    print(num)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, both iterators and generators allow you to work with sequences of data, but generators provide a more concise and memory-efficient way to create iterators, especially for situations where data generation is dynamic or resource-intensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "## \tComprehensions\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists and dictionaries can be created in a very compact way using comprehensions.\n",
    "They consist on one-liner expression, where a list (or dictionary) is created based on \n",
    "another iterable object. A condition can be added to filter the elements that are included \n",
    "in the new list. The syntax is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "new_list = [expression for item in iterable if condition == True]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, we can create a list with the squares of the numbers from 1 to 10\n",
    "as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "squares = [x**2 for x in range(1, 11)]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If only the squares of even numbers from 1 to 10 shall be included, we can tune the output \n",
    "adding a condition:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "squares = [x**2 for x in range(1, 11) if x % 2 == 0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Comprehensions can also be used to create dictionaries. For instance, we can create\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "squares = {x: x**2 for x in range(1, 11)}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we need to iterate over keys (`x` in our example) and values (`x**2`). We can for instance\n",
    "run over tuples that contain `(key, value)` pairs. \n",
    "In the following example, we generate in-place a list of tuples containing the letters\n",
    "and their position in the alphabet:"
