    "# Additional notes on I/O\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, we already acquired the basic skills to write a \n",
    "working Python code. An important part of the code is reading external\n",
    "data and writing results. We already learned the basics on \n",
    "[Input/Output](fundamentals.io) and,\n",
    "in this chapter, we give a closer look on how to print messages \n",
    "and results to the screen  and files with a proper format.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The `print` function\n",
    "\n",
    "The central function for printing in Python is `print`. It can be\n",
    "used to print a single variable (of any kind) or a sequence of \n",
    "variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print('Hello world!', 1.5, True, [1, 2, 3], sep=' | ', end='\\n--\\n')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Some keyword arguments can be used to modify the output. For example, \n",
    "we can specify the character(s) at the end of the line with the `end` \n",
    "keyword. The default value is the newline character `\\n` (new line), \n",
    "so if we use `end=''` we will get subsequent statements printed in \n",
    "the same line. Another keyword that tune the output is `sep`, which\n",
    "specifies the string use as separator between variables (if a sequence \n",
    "of variables is given). The default value is a space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important keyword is `file`, which specifies the output\n",
    "stream. The argument must be a file object, usually generated with the\n",
    "`open` function. Note that the file should be writable (i.e., using\n",
    "the keyword `w` on opening). The default value \n",
    "is `sys.stdout`, which is the standard output stream. \n",
    "\n",
    "```{exercise}\n",
    ":nonumber:\n",
    ":class: dropdown\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a program that prints the numbers from 0 to 10 in the same line,\n",
    "waiting 1 second between each number. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint*: use the `time.sleep` function to wait 1 second. \n",
    "You may also need to add the `flush=True` keyword to the `print` function\n",
    "to avoid buffering the output.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Before closing this section, we will look at an alternative way to\n",
    "print variables, i.e., through the `write` method of file objects.\n",
    "One of the main differences with the `print` function is that the\n",
    "`write` method does not add a newline character at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Set file object to standard output\n",
    "f = sys.stdout\n",
    "\n",
    "# With write method\n",
    "f.write('Hello world!\\n')\n",
    "\n",
    "# With print function\n",
    "print('Hello world!', file=f)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Formatting your output\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that while we can print any variable with the `print` function \n",
    "it does not allow us to specify the format of the output (e.g., \n",
    "specify the number of decimals for a float). To do this, we need to \n",
    "generate a string that will contain the variables with the desired\n",
    "format. We then pass such a string to the `print` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three ways to generate a string with variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `format` method of the string.\n",
    "- `f-strings` (formatted strings, since Python 3.6).\n",
    "- String modulo operator (`%`).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the two first cases, the string is a template that contains placeholders\n",
    "for the variables identified by curly braces `{}`. The more general\n",
    "syntax is `{<variableID>:<format>}`. The way `<variableID>` is \n",
    "specified depends on the method used to generate the string. Namely, \n",
    "the `format()` function contains the variables as arguments, and `<variableID>`\n",
    "is the position of the variable in the argument list. If no identifier\n",
    "is used, the variables are used in the order they appear in the \n",
    "argument list. The `f-strings` are defined with the `f`\n",
    "modifier, i.e., `f\"my_string\"`. They are a bit more flexible, and allow to \n",
    "directly use a variable, or any valid Python expression as `<variableID>`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The third method uses the `%` character as placeholder within the string,\n",
    "with syntax `%<format>`, where in this case `<format>` must be specified.\n",
    "The variables to substitute are given after the string, using a tuple\n",
    "if more than one is given.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Using the format method\n",
    "print('The value of x is {} and the value of y is {}'.format(x, y))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using f-strings\n",
    "print(f'The value of x is {x} and the value of y is {y}')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using string modulo operator (%)\n",
    "print('The value of x is %s and the value of y is %s' % (x, y))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `<format>` field is a string that specifies the format of the variable, \n",
    "with details such as the total width, the number of decimals or\n",
    "the alignment. The most common syntax is `<align>W<type>`, where\n",
    "`<align>` is the alignment (not available with `%` method, and optional\n",
    "with the other two), `W` is the total width (and may also \n",
    "include the number of positions after the period for floats as `W.n`), and \n",
    "`<type>` is the format type. The most common types are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `s`: string (actually not necessary with {} place-holders, since it is the default)\n",
    "* `d`: integer (again, not necessary with {})\n",
    "* `f`: float in decimal format\n",
    "* `e`: float in scientific notation\n",
    "* `g`: float in scientific notation or decimal format, or integer, depending on the value\n",
    "\n",
    "The alignment can be specified with the `<align>` part of the format, and the \n",
    "most usual options are: `<` (left aligned), `>` (right aligned), and `^`\n",
    "(centered). The default is left alignment for strings, and right alignment\n",
    "for numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look to the outcome of different formats for the same\n",
    "variables."
